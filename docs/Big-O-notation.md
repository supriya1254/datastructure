# Big-O Notation :
- It is a way of expressing the time complexity related to the number of items that an algorithm has to deal with.
- Or it gives us a way of comparing time complexity of different algorithms in an object manner, in a hardware-independent manner.
- here are the Big-O values:
    - O(1) : Constant
    - O(logn) : Logarithmic
    - O(n) : Linear
    - O(nlogn) : n log-star n
    - O(n2) or big-O(n square) : Quadratic


- how many steps does it take to run an algorithm?


- number of sugar increase, then the number of steps will increase
